In the **Simple Slider project**, you will learn how to create a basic image slider using JavaScript. The project will cover two navigation methods for the slideshow:

### Project Features:
1. **Button Navigation**:
   - **Hide/Show Buttons**: 
     - The "previous" button will be hidden at the start of the slideshow.
     - The "next" button will be hidden at the end of the slideshow.
   - Users can navigate through the images, but buttons will be concealed based on the current position in the slideshow.

2. **Circular Navigation**:
   - In this setup, when users reach the end of the slideshow, they will circle back to the beginning.
   - Conversely, when at the beginning and attempting to go back, users will be taken to the last image in the slideshow.
   - This method maintains continuous navigation without hiding buttons.

### Conclusion:
- The project aims to provide a foundational understanding of how to implement a simple slider, which can be expanded upon later in the course for more complex functionality.
